				Hi everyone! I’m Riya and I’m super excited to be your president this
				year! I’m currently a junior at MVHS, and have been doing MUN for six years
				— since my first year of middle school. MUN is a super thrilling experience
				that alongside teaching you political relationships and real-world issues,
				allows you to learn about public speaking and coming up with speeches on the
				fly. Outside of MUN, I enjoy reading, writing (both with El Estoque and doing
				poetry), as well as editing (for a competition called Polyphony Lit). Looking
				forward to meeting you all!
